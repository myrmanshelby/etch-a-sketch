# Etch-a-sketch

This is a simple etch-a-sketch inspired by the Etch-a-Sketch project in The Odin Project bootcamp.

## Introduction

This etch-a-sketch contains a screen with a customizable number of squares (pen size) on which the user can draw by hovering, leaving a pixelated trail as a pen would.

The user can customize the pen color using the built-in RGB color palette. Additionally, they can click the "Rainbow" button to generate a trail of randomly-colored squares. The erase buttons allows the user to remove the pen trail, and the reset button clears the screen.
